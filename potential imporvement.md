Immediate (Week 1-2):

Split the monolithic file into modules as shown in the refactored structure
Add comprehensive error handling using the patterns from the error handling artifact
Implement basic testing with the testing framework provided
Add configuration validation to prevent runtime errors

Short-term (Month 1):

Performance optimizations: Lazy loading, caching, connection pooling
Enhanced logging with structured logging and log rotation
Health monitoring system with automated recovery
Documentation for developers and users

Medium-term (Months 2-3):

Production deployment setup with Docker/systemd
Monitoring and alerting system
Automated testing pipeline with CI/CD
Security hardening and audit

ðŸš¨ Critical Security Notes:

Never store API keys in code - use environment variables or secure key management
Validate all user inputs, especially for automation commands
Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
Regular security audits of dependencies

ðŸ“Š Architecture Recommendations:
Current: Single 1000+ line file
Recommended: Modular structure with ~10-15 focused modules

Benefits:
âœ… Easier testing and debugging
âœ… Better team collaboration
âœ… Improved maintainability
âœ… Cleaner separation of concerns
âœ… Easier to add new features
ðŸ’¡ Next Steps:

Start with modularization - this will make everything else easier
Add tests gradually - focus on core functionality first
Implement proper logging - you'll thank yourself when debugging
Set up monitoring - know when things break before users do
